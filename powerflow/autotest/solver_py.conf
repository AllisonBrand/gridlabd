# solver_py.conf
#
# This file manages the python solver configution.
# It is loaded when the solver is initialized.
#

#
# solver
#
# Controls the functionality of the python solver.
# The default is "enable".
#
# Use "disable" to disable the python solver.

solver enable

#
# logfile
#
# Defines the log file to use when storing log data.
# The default is /usr/local/var/gridlabd/solver_py.log
#

logfile ./solver_py.log

#
# loglevel
#
# Defines the level of log report stored in the log.
# The default is 0 (errors only).
#
#  -1 blocks logging
#   0 only errors
#   1 first level log entries
#   2 second level log entries
#   ...
#   9 all log entries
#

loglevel 9

#
# busdump
#
# Specify the file into which the bus data is dumped.
# The default is none.
#
# Placing a "+" in front of the filename causes the dumps
# to append to the file instead of clearing a new file for each dump.
# 

#busdump ./solver_bus.csv

#
# branchdump
#
# Specify the file into which the branch data is dumped.
# The default is none.
#
# Placing a "+" in front of the filename causes the dumps
# to append to the file instead of clearing a new file for each dump.
# 

#branchdump ./solver_branch.csv

#
# import_path
#
# Specifies a folder to search before using the default python path when
# importing the python solver.
#

import_path ..

#
# import
#
# Specifies the name of the python solver module to import.
#

import solver_py

#
# on_dump
#
# Specifies the function to call after a dump is completed.
# The default is none.
#
# The function must be defined in the python solver module.
# 
#on_dump check_dumps

#
# busdata
#
# This identifies which bus data items are copied to the solver
#
# Use tag1,tag2,... to get (this is the default is bus/branch data are omitted)
#   [[id1,data11,data12,...],[id2,data21,data22,...]

#
# branchdata
#
# This identifies which branch data items are copied to the solver
#
# Use the same tag format as for busdata to control how the data is copied.

# learndata
#
# This identifies which learning data is copied to the 'learn' method. See the
# data structure for the NR powerflow (powerflow/solver_nr.h) for details.
#

# All powerflow solution data
#learndata powerflow_values

# Selected powerflow solution data
